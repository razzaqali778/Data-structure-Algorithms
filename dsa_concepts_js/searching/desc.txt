Linear Search:

Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found.
It starts from the beginning of the list and compares each element with the target value.
If a match is found, it returns the index of the element; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that the target value is not present in the list.
Linear Search has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
Binary Search:

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays.
It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the middle element with the target value.
If the middle element is equal to the target value, it returns the index of the element.
If the middle element is greater than the target value, the search continues in the left half of the array.
If the middle element is less than the target value, the search continues in the right half of the array.
Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the sorted array.
Depth-First Search (DFS):

Depth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Starting from a specific vertex, DFS visits all reachable vertices by recursively exploring the adjacent vertices.
It uses a stack (or recursion) to keep track of the vertices to visit.
DFS can be used to find connected components, detect cycles, and solve problems like maze traversal.
The time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.
It starts at a specific vertex and visits all its neighbors before moving to the next level of neighbors.
BFS uses a queue to keep track of the vertices to visit.
BFS is often used to find the shortest path between two vertices, find connected components, and solve problems like puzzle solving.
The time complexity of BFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
